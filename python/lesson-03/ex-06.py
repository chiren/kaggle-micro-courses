Exercise 06:

Define a function named grade which takes 1 argument score
and return grade 'A' if score is >= 90, 'B' if score is between 80 and 89(inclusive)
'C' if score is between 70 and 79(inclusive), 'D' if score is <= 69

Call your grade function with 4 numbers, and print out the results

ex:

a, b, c, d = 92, 73, 67, 85

print(a, "grade:", grade(a))
print(b, "grade:", grade(b))
print(c, "grade:", grade(c))
print(d, "grade:", grade(d))
